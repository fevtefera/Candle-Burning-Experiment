Candle Burning Experiment
Goal: Investigate the effect of additives and freezing on candle-burning rates.
Description: This project explored how different treatments (e.g., salt, baking soda, essential oils, freezing) impacted the burning rates of taper candles. Using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests, we analyzed statistical differences in burn rates among treatment groups.

Techniques Used: Exploratory Data Analysis, ANOVA, Welch’s ANOVA, Tukey’s Post-Hoc Test.
Key Findings: Contrary to common beliefs, additives like salt and baking soda increased the burning rate, while freezing did not significantly slow it down.
