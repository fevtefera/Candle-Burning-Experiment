Candle Burning Experiment
Goal: Investigate the effect of additives and freezing on candle-burning rates.

Description:
This project explored how different treatments (e.g., salt, baking soda, essential oils, freezing) impacted the burning rates of taper candles. Using statistical methods like one-way ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons, we analyzed differences in burning rates among treatment groups.

Key Features:

Explored the impact of additives and freezing on burning rates.
Used ANOVA to assess statistical differences and post-hoc tests to identify specific group effects.
Visualized distributions and trends for better interpretation.
Key Findings:

Additives like salt and baking soda increased the burning rate, contrary to popular belief.
Freezing candles did not significantly slow down their burning rates.
Tools and Techniques:

Tools: R
Techniques: One-Way ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA, Tukey's Post-Hoc Test
